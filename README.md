## Motivation
I wanted to create a calendar app that combines basic functionality that users would expect from such an app,
along with a unique, fun display.

## Summary
This app allows users to create a password-protected calendar to store their events.
Users create a single calendar (which can be deleted and edited) and can create, view, edit, and delete events.
